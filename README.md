# FileSorter

FileSorter is a simple PyQt5 application designed to help you organize your files by automatically categorizing them into folders based on their file extensions. With File Mover, you can easily monitor a selected folder and ensure that your files are neatly organized for easy access.

## Features

- **GUI Application:** File Mover provides a user-friendly graphical interface for selecting a source folder and triggering the file monitoring process.
  
- **Automatic File Categorization:** Files are automatically sorted into folders based on their file extensions, such as images, videos, music, and documents.

- **Handling Duplicates:** File Mover handles duplicate file names by appending a counter to the filename to prevent overwriting.

- **Document Subfolders:** Within the "Documents" folder, specific subfolders are created for different document types (PDF, CSV, TEXT, PPT, WORD, Other) to further organize your files.
